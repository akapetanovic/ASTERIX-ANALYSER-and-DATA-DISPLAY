            <li>If default values are specified the ToKML methods will not render those elements
                to keep the file size to a minimum.&nbsp; </li>
            <li>Abstract classes will not write beginning and end elements since they will be inherited
                by other objects that will do that.&nbsp; They can, however, render shared elements
                and attributes that are shared across the objects that inherit them.</li></ul>
